With the rise of Machine Learning and AI to solve human-focused needs, how do we design and use data science ethically to help empower and support people? This panel discussion at IDEO's headquarters is part of the Machine Learning and User Experience San Francisco ([MLUXSF](https://www.mluxsf.com/)) group, featuring Elizabeth Churchill (Director of User Experience at Google), Stuart Geiger (staff ethnographer at the UC-Berkeley Institute for Data Science), Irmak Sirer (Design Director at IDEO), Kristian Lum (Lead Statistician at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group), and moderator Sherry Wong (Electronic Frontier Foundation). Each will present a range of perspectives and discuss how they approach this topic, and what to keep in mind for our own practices.
