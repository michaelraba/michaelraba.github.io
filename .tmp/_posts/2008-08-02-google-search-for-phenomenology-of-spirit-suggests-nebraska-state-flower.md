As you may know, Google often thinks it knows what you are looking for better than you do.  It will suggest different search queries and display them underneath the top three results for your original query.  So I did a simple Google search for &#8220;Phenomenology of Spirit,&#8221; an 1807 book written by German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel today and found a very interesting suggestion.

If you don&#8217;t believe me, [try it out yourself!](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22phenomenology+of+spirit%22&btnG=Search) The sad thing is that by making this post, I am making this association closer in Google&#8217;s eyes. What to do?
