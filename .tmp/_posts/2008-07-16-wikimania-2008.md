I am currently in Egypt for [Wikimania 2008](http://wikimania2008.wikimedia.org), which is being held this year at the Library of Alexandria. On Sunday, I will be presenting my ethnographic analysis of conceptions and misconceptions academics hold about Wikipedia. This presentation was going to be about old, computer-illiterate professors but has turned into something much more interesting: a commentary on Wikipedia&#8217;s status in the so-called postmodern digital humanities. I will update the [post on this site](http://www.stuartgeiger.com/wordpress/conference-presentations/2008/05/10/conceptions-and-misconceptions-academics-hold-about-wikipedia/) as I finalize my presentation.

I will also be blogging and [Twittering](http://www.twitter.com/staeiou) about the conference. Stay tuned for updates.
