This is a paper I co-authored with [David Ribes](http://www.davidribes.com) and recently presented at <a href="http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">HICSS</a>, the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences.  It&#8217;s a qualitative methodology based on analyzing logging data that we developed through my research on Wikipedia, but has some pretty broad applications for studying highly-distributed groups.  It&#8217;s an inversion of the [previous paper we presented at CSCW](http://www.stuartgeiger.com/wordpress/academic-works/2009/10/28/the-work-of-sustaining-order-in-wikipedia-the-banning-of-a-vandal/), showing in detail how we traced how Wikipedian vandal fighters as they collectively work to identify and ban malicious contributors.

Abstract: We detail the methodology of ‘trace ethnography’, which combines the richness of participant-observation with the wealth of data in logs so as to reconstruct patterns and practices of users in distributed sociotechnical systems.  Trace ethnography is a flexible, powerful technique that is able to capture many distributed phenomena that are otherwise difficult to study.  Our approach integrates and extends a number of longstanding techniques across the social and computational sciences, and can be combined with other methods to provide rich descriptions of collaboration and organization.
