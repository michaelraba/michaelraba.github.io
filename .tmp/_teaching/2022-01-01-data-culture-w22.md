## COMM 106D: Data and Culture -- Winter 2022 (UCSD Communication)

**Instructor:** Prof. Stuart Geiger (COMM106D@stuartgeiger.com)

**Time:** MW 9-9:50am, F asynchronous and online (blended mode)

**Course summary:** Developments in artificial intelligence are being combined with unprecedented levels of personal data collection, which are used to make inferences about who we are, what we are interested in, and where we belong. In response, this course takes a cultural lens to issues around data and AI. What are the practices and politics of quantifying humans and society? How do technologies like personalized microtargeting and machine learning actually work? How are classic and contemporary culture industries (film, TV, journalism, video games, etc.) are using data and AI in their work? What are the implications of giving us the search results that will keep our eyeballs on the screen the longest? The issues that arise in representing culture through analyses of data date back to the first censuses in ancient times, but have taken a turn with new methods and data. What do these approaches capture and what do they miss? 

**Relationship to other COMM courses:** This course may have a some amount of overlap with related courses in the department, including COMM 106E (Data, Science, and Society, which I’ll teach in S22), COMM 106I (Internet Industries), and COMM 162 (Culture Industries). However, it is designed to take a different perspective and cover a different set of topics. We will largely \*not\* be focusing on topics that are more central to these other courses, such as the role of data and AI in sectors like criminal justice, surveillance, banking, hiring, admissions, welfare benefits, or science --- which will be the focus on 106E in S22.

**Scheduling and hybrid format** This class is officially scheduled for MWF 9-9:50am. Monday and Wednesday will be syncronous (Zoom or in-person depending on university administrative decisions). The Friday "hour" will be an asynchronous online participation component, which must be completed at a time of your choice between the end of class on Wednesday and 11:59pm on Saturday. 

**Prerequisites:** This is an intermediate elective, so only COMM 10 as a prereq or a co-req. This means you can enroll in this class at the same time as taking COMM 10. You must submit an EASY request after enrolling in COMM 10. See<https://communication.ucsd.edu/undergrad/academic-overview/faqs.html#I-want-to-enroll-in-COMM-10-and>. No other prereqs are required. We will learn some aspects about how data science and AI works, but this course assumes no prior knowledge of computing. 

### Assessment 


- 15% Mon/Wed in-person participation (you can miss up to 3 classes unexcused; 4 unexcused absences will be penalized 1 letter grade)

- 15% Friday virtual participation

- 20% Take home essays (400-500 words, 3 assignments, lowest grade dropped):

  - Write about a real-world system of quantification and its consequences
  - Write about an algorithmic imaginary of a social networking site
  - Write about the use of data/AI in a culture industry

- 20% Group midterm performance/skit/parody project, comprised of:

  - 5% proposal
  - 10% group grade, with points distributed by group members
  - 5% statement of group work

- 30% Final, comprised of:

  - 5% Final paper/project proposal

**Midterm:** The midterm will be a group performance project, in which groups of 3-5 students will produce a 5-7 minute segment on a topic related to the class. You will have to propose the topic beforehand. You are free to choose the format, genre, and whether it is recorded or live.

**Final:** The final will be a final paper/project of your choice related to the class content. The default format for the final project is a 1750-2000 word paper, but students who have experience with filmmaking, creative writing, web design, data science, etc., can propose an alternative format drawing on their skills.
