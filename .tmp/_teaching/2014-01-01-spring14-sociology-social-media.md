SOC 167 is an elective undergraduate course in UC-Berkeley&apos;s Sociology Department, providing a wide overview to how classic concepts in the social sciences play out in social media and virtual communities. This semester, there was an unexpected vacancy and the department needed a lecturer with only a couple weeks of advance notice. I was part of a team with three other lecturers who collectively re-designed the course and split up the lectures and administrative duties for the semester.
