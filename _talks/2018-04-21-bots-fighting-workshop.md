In this workshop, I walk through the workflow behind a recent mixed-methods paper, in which we sought to replicate and extend a previously-published paper. The research question was about how often community-approved bots in Wikipedia were "fighting" with each other. We took issue with how prior work had defined and measured conflict between bots, and used qualitative research to create several alternative ways of quantitatively measuring and operationalizing this culturally-specific concept. I talk about how we sought to make our data collection and analysis as open and reproducible as possible, discussing specifics of how we worked towards these goals with various tools, techniques, platforms, and infrastructures throughout the research process. This talk does not require pre-existing knowledge about tools, techniques, platforms, and infrastructures.
