Since Fall 2016, I have been the lead coordinator for [The Hacker Within](http://thehackerwithin.org/berkeley/), a peer learning group run out of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, where learners meet 1.5-2 hours a week to teach each other a new language, library, platform, concept, or other topic related to data science and scientific computing. The group exists to fill in the gaps of the universityâ€™s standard curricula, give learners a low-risk, low-prerequisite environment to get started with data science, and build a community across campus.
