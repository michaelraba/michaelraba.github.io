[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) is an international non-profit organization that teaches computing and data science skills to researchers in short, no-cost workshops (2-5 days). Becoming a certified software carpentry instructor involved taking a programming-focused pedagogy course, assisting a veteran instructor with running a workshop, then passing a teaching evaluation in a live classroom setting.
