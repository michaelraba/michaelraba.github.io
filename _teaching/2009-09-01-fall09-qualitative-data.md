CCTP-783 is a core methods course for the CCT program, one of multiple classes M.A. students can take to satisfy their core methods requirement. The course covers a range of qualitative data analysis methods and methodologies, focusing on grounded theory, ethnography, and content analysis. My duties included: General logistical work to prepare for classes; working as needed with individual students to develop research agendas, theoretical orientations, and multiple qualitative data analysis techniques.
