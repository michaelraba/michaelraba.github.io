INFO 103 is an elective undergraduate course in the UC-Berkeley School of Information, crosslisted with History, Media Studies, and Cognitive Science. The course aims to teach students to think about information technology across a variety of contexts, beginning with the creation of writing and currency and ending with social media. My duties included: providing administrative support to professors; grading weekly reading response assignments and exams; holding weekly office hours; and giving one lecture per semester.
