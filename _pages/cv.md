Skill 1 - The Most Important Skill of all, Problem-Solving.
======

  * <u>Self-directed</u>
  * ability to leverage all resources to identify problems and come up with effective solutions

Skill 2 - Scientific Parallel Computing.
======

* Parallel Computing: MPI and OpenMP (C++, Fortran, Julia, Matlab and Python )
  * Profile code and effectively combine OpenMP with MPI for /actually good performant code/ using Totalview and GDB (including its Python interface); ability to help others' issues also.
  * Configure and optimize Linux systems (CentOS, Arch, Ubuntu)

#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

// The rest of the MPI code goes here...
