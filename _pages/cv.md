</div>
{% endcomment %}

Skill 1 - Scientific Parallel Computing:
======

* Parallel Computing: MPI and OpenMP (C++, Fortran, Julia, Matlab and Python ) ; datastructures and memory profiling (GDB,totalview); large data (hdf5 & szip/lzf);
  * Version control (git $\rightarrow$ branching & merging, CI/CD tools to automate test,build, & deployment)
  * Configure and optimize Linux systems (CentOS, Arch, Ubuntu) and do amazing things everyone asks me, how can I do that?



Skill 2 - Hardcore Applied Mathematics:
======

  * Finite Volume Methods & Computational gasdynamics
  * Signal Processing (eg Fourier analysis)
  * Functional Analysis (2 semesters of graduate level PDE), Matrix Methods, and their interplay


Skill 3 - This is the most important Skill I have:
======

  * <u>Self-directed & Proactive</u>
  *  Ability to <b>leverage all resources</b> to identify problems and come up with effective solutions. This includes reading papers, connecting dots, small test, profiling code, verification ... super-innovative and multi-diciplinary curious


Education
======
* B.A. in Applied Mathematics, University of Kentucky, 2019
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of Kentucky, forthcoming 2023
