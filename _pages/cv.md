Skill 1 - Scientific Parallel Computing:
======

- Parallel Computing: MPI and OpenMP (C++, Fortran, Julia, Matlab and Python ) ;<br>
- Datastructures and _Effective C++_  ðŸ˜‰ <br>
- Memory profiling (GDB,totalview); large data (hdf5 & szip/lzf);<br>
- Version control (git â†’ branching & merging, CI/CD tools to automate test,build, & deployment)<br>
- Configure and optimize Linux systems (CentOS, Arch, Ubuntu) and do amazing things everyone asks me, how can I do that?<br>


Skill 2 - Applied Mathematics:
======

  * Finite Volume Methods & Computational gasdynamics
  * Signal Processing (Fourier analysis)
  * Functional Analysis (2 semesters of graduate level PDE)
  * Graduate-level Matrix Methods, and their interplay
  * Reduced Order Modeling Techniques

Skill 3 - Ask the Right Questions
======

*  <b>Leverage all resources to identify problems to come up with effective solutions: </b> 
* Quickly able to familarize new areas by: reading papers, connecting dots, small test, profiling code, <b> and yes, asking more questions</b>; 
* Cultivate a deliberate mindset of being super-innovative and multi-diciplinary curious.
