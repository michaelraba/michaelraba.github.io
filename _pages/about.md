I am a student in Mechanical Engineering with:
* Expertise in partial differential equations in both numerics and fuctional analytic viewpoints,
* Statistical approaches to fluid mechanics <i>with an</i>
* Emphasis on scientific, MPI- and OpenMP-based paralllel computing.

Currently pursing a research grant-funded PhD position; See my MsC thesis <b>here</b>

  <figcaption>Most Energetic part of a <b>homogeneous wall-bounded turbulent flow</b> in a pipe. The 5th Azimuthal mode, $\langle\Phi^{(n=1,N=3.0,Re=5,300)}_x(r;\theta;m=5)\rangle_x$ is shown, where $n$ is the POD mode, $N=3.0$ is the swirl number, and $Re=5,300$ is the Reynolds number of a moderately turbulent flow. 
  
Such POD decompositions form a 'cartoon' version of an otherwise complex turbulent flow, which we can engineer and also better control.</figcaption>
