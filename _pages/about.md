  <figcaption>Most Energetic part of flow of a pipe for Reynolds Number 5300. The 5th Azimuthal mode, $\langle\Phi^{(1)}_x(r;\theta;m=5)\rangle_x$ is shown. Such POD decompositions form a 'cartoon' version of an otherwise complex turbulent flow, which we can engineer and also better control.</figcaption>
