title: "Post-Structuralism, Restructured: Re-presentations of Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus"
excerpt: "This was my final project for an Information Studies class I took back in 2006 at UT-Austin. Our assignment was to transform information from one form to another, and I chose to perform this analysis of Deleuze and Guattari’s <i>A Thousand Plateaus</i>. I scanned and OCRed the entire book and did a visual frequency representation of certain words."
