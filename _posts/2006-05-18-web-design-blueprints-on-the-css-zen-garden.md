This was a CSS stylesheet I wrote for the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/), which is a really cool concept in web design. There is a standard HTML page in which all the content is wrapped up in div tags, and the idea is to write a CSS stylesheet that makes it pretty. Mine was based on blueprints, and can be accessed [here](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=http://stuartgeiger.com/blueprints/style.css). It turns out that I didn&#8217;t make into the [accepted designs](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/), but I did get on the list of those that [didn&#8217;t make the cut](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/others/). I can see why &#8211; it needs some cleaning up around the lines which I might do if I have some time. But I&#8217;ll take being top of that list.
