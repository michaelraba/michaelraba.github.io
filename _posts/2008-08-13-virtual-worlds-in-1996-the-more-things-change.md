I came across this [1996 review published in Entertainment Weekly of The Palace, Worldsaway, and Worlds Chat](http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292351,00.html). These were the first graphical chat programs, a genre which became virtual worlds a half-decade later. The entire article is fascinating from a historical perspective, but the last paragraph in particular shows us how some things really do stay the same:

> You may also notice that nobody&#8217;s talking, at least out loud. Like all chat software, WC lets you send private messages, but it also enables you to talk in private groups, so there&#8217;s no real impetus for public discourse. Besides, most here have one thing on their minds, and it ain&#8217;t badminton. The typical experience is stumbling into a room, seeing two avatars nose to nose over in the corner, and realizing — just as at any cocktail party — that three&#8217;s a crowd. Bizarre? Sure. Sick? Maybe. A sign of modern alienation? Unquestionably. Yet in a way it&#8217;s a relief to know that even in this newest of mediums, there&#8217;s a place for the oldest of urges.
